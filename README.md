# Python Coinbase Ranking

# Coinbase App Store Ranking Scraper

This Python script scrapes the App Store page for the Coinbase app and extracts its ranking in the Finance category.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library
- `beautifulsoup4` library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

The script will output the ranking of the Coinbase app in the Finance category on the App Store.

Notes
The URL in the script is specific to the US App Store. You may need to adapt it based on your country/region.
The script assumes that the ranking information is contained within an <a> tag with the class inline-list__item and a specific href attribute. You may need to inspect the App Store webpage and adjust the script if the structure changes.
